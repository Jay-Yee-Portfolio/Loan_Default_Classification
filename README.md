# Classification of Loan Default Probabilities

The dataset for this project are personal loans that Lending Club originated from 2009-2017. The data was cleaned to remove invalid entries and loans that didn't fit the project's parameters. Afterwards, EDA was conducted that identified categories that were used as predictor features against the target feature of whether or not the specific loan defaulted. 

The data processing can be found [here](https://github.com/Jay-Yee-Portfolio/Loan_Default_Classification/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Feature%20Engineering.ipynb) while the predictive model is [here.](https://github.com/Jay-Yee-Portfolio/Loan_Default_Classification/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Predictive%20Model.ipynb)
